                    <p>I have been an avid LEGO fan since the age of 5. All throughout my childhood years, I collected and displayed my LEGO like trophies. Some were meant to be displayed while others were arguably meant to be played with (though I would disagree).&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>When I packed up to go to college and cleaned out my room, I found myself regretfully packaging my LEGO and stuffing them all broken apart into cardboard boxes. During the year and a half that I was at college, the boxes stayed untouched and abandoned.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>When I came back home, I had the genius idea to re-open those boxes and uncover what treasures I had hidden. Truthfully, I have never put some of those sets back into those cardboard boxes. Since then, I have actually expanded my LEGO collection, despite many people finding the quirk to be quite childish.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>I regretfully admit that I have gotten rid of some LEGO since, but they would have truly been discarded otherwise. I will also note that I am unlikely to invest in new LEGO collections, as I already feel overwhelmed by the volume I currently own and display.&nbsp; Nonetheless, despite others' strong opinions, I think that I will never grow past the excitement and joy of building and displaying a classic LEGO.</p>
