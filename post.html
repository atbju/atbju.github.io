                    <p>For 14 years of my life, I thought I knew everything I needed to about potato chips. It wasn't until one morning that I found my bag of chips crushed at the bottom of my lunchbox that my life changed forever. At first, I was hesitant to eat them because there's something special about the crunch that each whole unique chip has. Nevertheless, I was too hungry to discard the bag.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>At that moment, I tasted chips in a way that I never had before. I could taste every flavor of the chip compacted into one tiny mouthful. While I no longer had the full crunch, it was still crunchy. I'm not sure I even know how to explain it - it's just something every person has to experience for themselves.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You would not believe how often I get harassed for such a decision. Yes, the bag of chips does look significantly smaller when crushed to small bits and pieces, but it is worth it. I can't make this decision for anyone. You just have to trust me that it is a life-changing experience.&nbsp;</p>
